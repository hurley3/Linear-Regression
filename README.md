# Linear Regression
This repository contains my work on linear regression, a statistical method used to model the linear relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.

## Contents
In this repository, you will find:

* A Jupyter notebook that explains the theory behind linear regression and demonstrates how to implement it in Python using the scikit-learn library
* A dataset used in the Jupyter notebook for demonstrating how to fit a linear regression model and make predictions
* A python script that contains functions for performing linear regression on a given dataset
## Requirements
To run the code in this repository, you will need:

* Python 3.7 or higher
* NumPy
* Pandas
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
## Usage
To use the code in this repository, follow these steps:

* Clone the repository to your local machine
* Install the required libraries
* Open the Jupyter notebook and run the code cells to understand how linear regression works and how to implement it in Python
* Use the provided python script and functions to perform linear regression on your own datasets
